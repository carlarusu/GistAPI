# GistAPI

## Details

Use the API provided by Github Gist API, to create a basic single-page application with any **Web framework**. The goal of this application is to allow its users to enter a username and get the full list of public Gists for that userâ€¨.

Here's the list of full functionality required for the assignment: 

- **Search**: When a user enters a username, they should be able to get a full list of public Gists by that user. 
- **Filetypes**: Convert the filetypes of the files in the Gist into a tag/badge (For example, if the returned Gist has a list of files containing Python and Javascript files, the items listed should have the respective tags/badges). 
- **Forks**: Additionally, include with the list of the Gists, the username/avatar of the last 3 users who have forked it. 
- **Gist contents**: When clicking one of the Gists, display the content of the file
